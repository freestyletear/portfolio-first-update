## Description
It‚Äôs hard to believe‚Ä¶ that we have come this far, what started out as nothing more than the gaze of a shooting star from a humble home, has come full circle to a dedicated and aspired human being, me. Now that the doors to prosperity are wide open( through Moringa School ) why wait any longer but show you what this humble brains can do, as of now i am on the verge of conquering front-end website design/ development training so as to gain knowledge that in return will be beneficial to both you and i and to show an example of this you will find some of the projects that i have already accomplished while you scroll along my portfolio, i leave the rest to you hope you will enjoy.

I did, i am and will continue to build this 'website' for it will and is containing fractions of parts of myself, by this i mean i seek to share the root of my development so as to coordinate with the rest of the world. With this as i call it My Portfolio i will be using this website to showcase my development from time to time.
